#Scribe Role Instructions

The scribe takes notes every meeting on which DxE Tech members attended the
meeting, the high level points that were addressed during the meeting, and the
action items that need to be done.

At the beginning of the meeting, open up a Google Doc and share it with everyone
in attendence. Copy the [meeting notes
template](https://github.com/directactioneverywhere/meetings/blob/master/template.md)
into the document, and note who is in attendence. You do not need to write down
every word that is said, an overview of the points made during the meeting is
enough. When you speak, you can ask the facilitator to write down the points
that you make so you don’t have to take notes on what you say. At the end of
the meeting, copy the notes into [the meeetings
folder](https://github.com/directactioneverywhere/meetings/tree/master/tech).

###Tips on what to write:

* DxE Tech does not engage in any illegal or criminal behavior, and the scribe
should be sure not to write down anything that may be misconstrued as illegal.
* Notes should conform with the [security culture
  guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yn5xIdYpl-ONtzjiKNrAFo7g2023OH72Q9ztUl7rfQY/edit).
* Don’t include names other than tech working group and organizers for whom the
particular task is relevant.
* Don’t include extraneous information (e.g. anything not related to tech working
group work).
* Err on the side of being boring and professional. If the press or another third
party gets a hold of our notes, we don’t want them to take anything out of
context.
* When in doubt, ask another member of DxE Tech or the DxE Global Steering
Committee.
