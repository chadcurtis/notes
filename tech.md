##Mission

The DxE Tech Working Group exists to build, procure, and advise on software
tools that help DxE activists be more effective.

##Values

As a group within DxE, we agree with and follow DxE's
[values](http://directactioneverywhere.com/organizing-principles), [conflict resolution
process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sZ66qBEYRcBzZV26qctn_mHoDn4cznRYI4vlFjBiHEE/edit),
 and [security culture guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yn5xIdYpl-ONtzjiKNrAFo7g2023OH72Q9ztUl7rfQY/edit).
In addition, we abide by DxE SF Bay's Code of Conduct and have our own guiding
values stated here.

###Software Values

* **Activist Usability.** Think from the perspective of the activists using the
tools. If activists won't use it, it's useless.
* **FOSS (free/open-source software).** Free/open source software promotes
transparency and collaboration, and empowers us to share our knowledge with
others.
* **Documentation.** In order to empower others in the working group to step up
and build off of your creation, document heavily with the target audience of
someone who has little knowledge of the domain. This also makes your work more
valuable to DxE if you leave the working group.

###Group Values

* **Equality.** Every member has equal decision making power.
* **Internal Transparency.** Every member of the group should have access to
the decisions we've made and most of the software we produce. A monopoly on
information creates a monopoly on decision making power.
* **Respect.** Every member respects one another. We acknowledge that we all
have different backgrounds, skills, and opinions. These differences make us
stronger.
* **Trust is Earned.** Members may need access to confidential information
and need to be trusted by each other and the DxE Global Steering Committee.
Access is granted on a need to know/use basis.
* **Teach Each Other.** As a group, we are stronger when we share our knowledge.
When skills are not shared, it creates bottlenecks on what we can accomplish
and single points of failure.


##Membership

The current member list is [here](members.md).

You do not need to be a member of the DxE Tech Working Group to participate and
sit in on meetings. Members can participate in the decision making process and
have access to the DxE Tech Working Group’s internal documents and services.
Members may also have access to other documents and services on a need-to-know
basis.

###Joining

We want to make sure that new members understand and respect our values. New
members must read this document, the DxE [values](http://directactioneverywhere.com/values),
 the DxE SF Bay Code of Conduct, the DxE [security culture guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yn5xIdYpl-ONtzjiKNrAFo7g2023OH72Q9ztUl7rfQY/edit),
and [Consensus Decision Making](https://github.com/directactioneverywhere/notes/blob/master/consensus.md).
They must also sit in on two meetings to observe and introduce themselves to
the group.


After the reading and the meeting requirements are fulfilled, the current
members have a short meeting using consensus to decide if the member should
be let in.

###Leaving

A member missing six consecutive meetings or violating any of our values
is grounds for being removed from the DxE Tech Working Group. Any member
that is removed from or leaves the DxE Tech Working Group must go through
the full process for joining again.


##Decision Making Procedure

DxE Tech uses consensus with explicit voting to make all decisions. A consensus
is loosely defined as when every member consents to the decision being made.
Read more about the process of consensus [here](https://github.com/directactioneverywhere/notes/blob/master/consensus.md).

To make sure that everyone has the opportunity to work on the group’s projects,
the group can use consensus to appoint an individual or a subcommittee to be
responsible for smaller decisions within a project.

For time sensitive decisions, sometimes individuals need to make decisions
on behalf of the group without consulting the group in a meeting. In those
cases, the individual should try to reach out to other members for input
and then go forward with the decision. They should report the decision to
 the group at the next meeting, where it can be discussed and reversed if
necessary.

The primary setting for making decisions is in our weekly meetings. The
structure of the meetings is defined [below](#meeting-structure-1).

We intentionally do not define what a quorum is. Use the values of equality
and respect to guide whether or not there are enough people to make a
decision, and transparently to make the decisions known to the absent members
 so that it can be discussed and reversed later if necessary.

##Group Roles
We don't believe that we need some members of the group (official leaders) to
have more power than others. However, some members may take on specific
responsibilities on behalf of the group. Having specific individuals play
specific roles is risky because it segments and concentrates power away
from the group. Despite this, we have one role -- the point of contact --
and to mitigate that risk we define it as follows.

###Point of Contact

This person will be "on call" as the point of contact for the Tech Working
Group. They are responsible for getting people the information they need
and coordinating the relevant Tech members to fix problems they are having.

For example, if Brenda emailed tech@ asking for help putting a facebook share
embed on the website and no one responded after a day, the point of contact will
be responsible for either telling Brenda we'll talk about it at the next
meeting, or if it's somewhat time sensitive, reaching out to Tech members and
getting them to commit to taking the lead on getting that work done.

The point of contact should respond to initial inquiries that have gone
**twenty-four hours** without a response. Anyone in the Tech Working Group may
respond to an inquiry, and in that case the point of contact is not obligated to
respond.

This person is not a leader, just the default point of contact between the tech
working group and the outside world. This person is chosen by the tech working
group, and the maximum term of service in the role is three months. After three
months, the tech group must explicitly chose a new member for the role.
Repeating the same member in the role is allowed but discouraged.

If the point of contact needs to suspend their duties for a day or more, then
they are responsible for getting a temporary replacement from tech.

##Meeting Structure

Every week, the members meet to report on work done and to make decisions about
future work.

###Meeting Roles

There are two roles for each meeting, which are rotated.

####Facilitator

The facilitator facilitates the discussion by bringing up issues on the agenda,
soliciting opinions from the group, trying to find consensus, and refocusing the
group on the agenda item if discussion strays. [Here are some tips on
facilitating](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lhKUlNgvEHGsmvBqq1x2L2wwSF08hnu70Fd596wjAyI/edit).
For detailed instructions on how to facilitate our meetings, see [here](facilitator.md).


####Scribe

The scribe takes notes to make the meetings transparent and easy to refer back
to. They write down who came to the meeting, what was discussed in the meeting
with agenda items, proposals, discussion, disagreement, decisions, and action
items. The scribe must understand DxE's [security culture
guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yn5xIdYpl-ONtzjiKNrAFo7g2023OH72Q9ztUl7rfQY/edit).
For detailed instructions on how to take notes as the scribe, see [here](scribe.md).

###Agenda

The agenda is the list of items that need to be discussed at the next meeting.
It includes things that need to be reported to the group, problems that the
group might try to solve, or decisions the group needs to make. Any member can
add items to the agenda before or during the meeting.

[The agenda is here](https://trello.com/b/QXlG5Nkr/sfbay-tech).


###Meeting Structure

The facilitator opens the meeting by asking people to introduce themselves if
anyone is sitting in on the meeting for the first time. Then, they ask everybody
if they share what they worked on that week. People are not required to only
share items related to the DxE Tech Group. Then the facilitator goes through the
agenda. There are more details on how to run a meeting
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VNKaTvBPhD24l9yDFBWQCniasPVH6NKVUyi95c8DSHQ/edit).
