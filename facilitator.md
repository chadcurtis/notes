#Facilitator Role Instructions

“The facilitator facilitates the discussion by bringing up issues on the agenda,
soliciting opinions from the group, trying to find consensus, and refocusing the
group on the agenda item if discussion strays.”

Prior to the start of the meeting it is recommended that the facilitator scan
through the agenda to make sure everything is in order and to loosely judge how
much time should be spent on each item. Reordering items in a logical manner is
advised.

Once the members have gathered, the facilitator will start the meeting by having
each member introduce themselves and say what they did the past week for the
Tech Working Group. All members are encouraged to do as much or as little work
as they desire.

After introductions are done, the facilitator should make sure that anyone who
does not want to be part of the rest of the meeting is encouraged to go and work
on tech projects.

The facilitator should then proceed to go through each item on the agenda and
discuss its importance, ask for opinions on the topic, make any changes
necessary to the item, ask members who wants to work on it, and assign it
accordingly. For each item the facilitator should make sure that everyone’s
opinions are heard and no one person is speaking too often. Additionally,
prompting members who haven’t spoken much on their thoughts is a good idea.

While respectful discussion is productive and helpful, digressing too far from
the subject is not. The facilitator should make sure that the discussion stays
on topic and no items take up too much time.
