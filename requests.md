#Tech Requests

To ensure that DxE Tech is able to swiftly help you with your tech request, we need the following information:

* Summary of the problem or request
  * For tech problems, please include any error messages and screenshots of the issue(s), how long the problem has been happening or when it was discovered, and whom the issue impacts
  * For tech requests, please include whom the request will impact, how it affects DxE, why it would be nice to have, and how likely it will be used
* How urgent it is
  * Is there a hard deadline? Does something else depend on it?

In order to prioritize things appropriately, especially for requests, we need insight into the context behind it. Since we're a volunteer team, we want to dedicate our time to things that will help DxE and its members the most. Requests with the most impact and likelihood to be used will be prioritized.

##Examples

###Problem

The email being sent to people who sign up for our mailing list recently broke â€“ the header image is no longer showing up. It was working last week. Attached is a screenshot of the broken email, along with the image that's supposed to be showing up. Could someone please fix this asap?

###Request

For the upcoming action next month, we would like to have a page on the site where people can upload a picture of themselves participating and, after I approve the image, it'll be a part of a slideshow on that page. Maybe the slideshow could also pop out into a lightbox? I'm picturing a black background, with the image taking up the entire browser window, and left/right arrows to click through all of the images.

This will help generate excitement for the action because activists will be able to see pictures of other people participating, which will hopefully encourage them to do it as well. It's also a way to prove broad international engagement; we can point to the page as evidence of our reach. We're telling all of our regional organizers to strongly suggest that their members take part, so this is pretty core to the action and very likely to be used.

The action is three weeks from now on Friday, so if someone is able to create a mostly done version in 2.5 weeks, that would give us enough time to finalize the rest of the page.
