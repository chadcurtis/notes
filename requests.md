#Tech Requests

To ensure that DxE Tech is able to swiftly help you with your tech request, we need the following information:

* Summary of the problem or request
  * For tech problems, please include any error messages and screenshots of the issue(s), how long the problem has been happening or when it was discovered, and whom the issue impacts
  * For tech requests, please include whom the request will impact, how it affects DxE, why it would be nice to have, and how likely it will be used
* How urgent it is
  * Is there a hard deadline? Is something else depending on it?

In order to prioritize things appropriately, especially for requests, we need insight into the context behind it. Since we're a volunteer team, we want to dedicate our time to things that will help DxE and its members the most.

##Examples

The email being sent to people who sign up for our mailing list recently broke – the header image is no longer showing up. It was working last week. Attached is a screenshot of the broken email, along with the image that's supposed to be showing up. Could someone please fix this asap?

For the upcoming action next month, we would like to have a counter on the site that shows how many people have RSVP'd to the Facebook event. It would look something like [this clock timer](http://flipclockjs.com/). This would be a way to show how popular our actions are to website visitors and how actively involved DxE members are. Depending on the actual number of people that RSVP, we probably won't show it if there are less than 100 people… However, it'd be nice to have in general, since we could reuse it for events in the future! The action is in three weeks, so if someone could have this done in two weeks, that'd be awesome.
