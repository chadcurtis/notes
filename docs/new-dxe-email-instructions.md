Instructions for creating a new DxE email account and setting it up as an alias for another gmail account.

You need admin permissions to create a DxE google user with an @directactioneverywhere.com.

1. Go to admin.google.com/directactioneverywhere.com
2. Click on 'users'
3. Click on the plus button in the bottom right ("Add User") and add a user. Create them with a temporary password (they'll be prompted to change it after logging in).
4. Email [new-dxe-email-instruction-email](https://github.com/directactioneverywhere/notes/blob/add_gmail_instructions/docs/new-dxe-email-instruction-email.txt) to the user's gmail (not their DxE email).
5. After they've set it up, test it by sending an email to their @directactioneverywhere.com email.
