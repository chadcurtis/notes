# Create a Selfie Collage in Gimp

1. open all the screenshots in gimp
2. open a blank canvas (1920 by 1080 is fine). You will make the selfie collage on this canvas.
3. Copy and paste the selfie from the open screenshot onto the selfie collage canvas. (Select the part you want with the Rectangle Select Tool, ctrl-c, ctrl-v on the collage canvas.)
4. In the "Layers" menu (usually in the top left), you should see an item for "Floating Pasted Layer". Turn it into a real layer so you can continue to manipulate it by right clicking the floating layer and selecting "To New Layer".
5. Position the layer with the Move Tool (shortcut: M). Change the size of the layer with the Scale Tool (shortcut: Shift + T).
6. Repeat steps 3 - 5 until you are satisified with the collage.

## Cropping the collage

If you need to crop the collage:

1. Merge all of the layers by going to the "Layers" menu, and clicking "Merge Down" on each layer until there is only a single layer.
2. Use the Crop Tool (shortcut: Shift + C) to select the part you want to crop. When you are satisfied, click the inside of the crop box to apply the crop.
