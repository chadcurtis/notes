# Create a Selfie Collage in Gimp

1. open all the screenshots in gimp
2. open a blank canvas (1920 by 1080 is fine). You will make the selfie collage on this canvas.
3. Copy and paste the selfie from the open screenshot onto the selfie collage canvas. (Select the part you want with the Rectangle Select Tool, ctrl-c, ctrl-v on the collage canvas.)
4. In the "Layers" menu (usually in the top left), you should see an item for "Floating Pasted Layer". Turn it into a real layer by right clicking the floating layer and selecting "To New Layer".
5. Position the layer with the Move Tool (shortcut: M). Change the size of the layer with the Scale Tool (shortcut: Shift + T).
6. Repeat steps 3 - 5 until done.
