Hey X,

These are the instructions for setting up your new DxE email,
x@directactioneverywhere.com.

Username: x@directactioneverywhere.com
Temporary Password: xyzxyzxyz

First, you need to log into
https://admin.google.com/directactioneverywhere.com with the above
credentials. It should prompt you to change your password. Change it to
something secure.

Linking your DxE email to your gmail:

1. Log onto your normal gmail account (x_original_email@gmail.com).
2. Click the gear in the top right, and then click "settings".
3. Click the Accounts tab at the top of the page.
4. Under Send mail as, click Add another email address.
5. In the Email address field, enter your name and your DxE email
address, x@directactioneverywhere.com.
6. Click Next Step >> and then click Send Verification. Gmail will send
a verification message to your other email address to confirm that you
own it.
7. Locate the message from Gmail. Open it and and either click the link
contained in the message or enter the confirmation code in the Accounts
section of your Google Apps email settings.

Let me know when you've finished and I can help you test your new email.
